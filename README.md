# What is this?

I have compiled a bunch of resources that has helped me out in learning software development, good coding practices as well as preparing for technical interviews.

Most of these focuses more on web development but hopefully these will still prove to be useful for any aspiring software engineers.

## Preparing for coding interviews(Leetcode)<a name="2"></a>

This portion focuses on resources that teaches you how to use leetcode effectively to prepare for coding interviews, there are also some resources for more front-end
focused roles as well as system design.

Personally, I only had time to prepare using Blind 75 for this internship season, which I found extremely useful.

## Preparing for coding interviews(System Design)<a name="3"></a>

I rarely get asked this for internship interviews, but I heard its more common in New Grad interviews. Nonetheless, system design is important to learn as software engineers when we have to build scalable big products.
